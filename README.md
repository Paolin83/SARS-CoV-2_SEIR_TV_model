Abstract
--------

In this study, we propose a time-dependent Susceptible-Infected-Exposed-Recovered (SEIR)
differential model for the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic outbreak in three different countries,
the United States of America, Italy and Iceland using public data inherent the numbers of the
epidemic wave. Several types and grades of actions were adopted by the governments, including
travel restrictions, social distancing, or limitation of movement. We want to investigate how these
measures can affect the epidemic curve of the infectious population. The parameters of interest for
the SEIR model were estimated employing a composite likelihood approach. Moreover, standard
errors have been corrected for the temporal dependence. The adoption of restrictive measures
results in flatten epidemic curves, and the future evolution indicated a decrease in the number of
cases.
